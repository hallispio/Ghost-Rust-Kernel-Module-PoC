# 📜 Development Log

### 2026-02-02
- **Environment Setup & Kernel Troubleshooting**
    - Initialized development environment on **Debian 13 (Trixie)**.
    - Resolved **Kernel Header mismatch** issues; successfully synchronized container headers with the host system.
    - Built and installed essential system tools: `GCC 14.2.0`, `Clang 19.1.7`, and `build-essential`.
    - Configured Rust toolchain for kernel-level development (Rust 1.93.0).

### 2026-02-03
- **Infrastructure & Documentation**
    - Established **Docker-to-GitHub pipeline** using Personal Access Tokens (PAT).
    - Initialized the official Git repository: `Universal-i18n-Layer-for-Linux-Kernel`.
    - Completed the first successful **Commit & Force Push** of the project skeleton.
    - Drafted the initial **README.md** including technical specifications and the `11ns/call` performance goal.
    - Verified `.devcontainer` and `.github` workflow configurations.

### 2026-02-04
- **Rust-Kernel Bridge Success & API Mapping**
    - Successfully implemented **Rust-to-Kernel FFI** using `bindgen`.
    - Automated kernel header path mapping in `build.rs` to support dynamic kernel versions (`uname -r`).
    - Resolved critical **Memory Alignment (E0588)** and **Panic Strategy (Unwinding)** conflicts for `no_std` environment.
    - Verified direct kernel function calling: successfully invoked `_printk` from Rust space.
    - Generated a comprehensive **Kernel API Map** (Functions & Structs) to identify critical interception points.
    - Established the "Minimal Gatekeeping" strategy: focused targeting of `vfs_write` and `copy_from_user` for performance-centric translation.

### 2026-02-05
- **WSL2 Structural Limits & Advanced Traffic Control**
    - **Relocation Error Investigation**: Diagnosed the persistent `Unknown rela relocation: 9` (`R_X86_64_GOTPCREL`) error.
    - **Environment Conflict Resolution**: Identified that the WSL2 kernel module loader lacks support for specific ELF relocation types generated by modern Rust/LLVM.
    - **Architectural "Traffic Control"**:
        - Implemented a **Custom Target JSON (`x86_64-kernel.json`)** to force-inject kernel-specific DNA (static relocation model, no-redzone) into the Rust compiler.
        - Established a **Hierarchy-based Build System**: Configured `.cargo/config.toml` as the "Source of Truth" to override conflicting environment variables.
    - **Toolchain Automation**:
        - Integrated `rust-toolchain.toml` for automatic **Nightly Rust** and `rust-src` component management.
        - Refined `build.rs` with critical Ftrace flags (`-mfentry`, `-DCC_USING_FENTRY`) for modern kernel compatibility.
    - **Build Success & Native Transition**:
        - Successfully achieved **`Build Complete`** status, proving the Rust-to-Kernel logic is flawless.
        - Confirmed the "Invalid Module Format" in WSL is a host-kernel limitation, not a code defect.
    - **Repository Hardening**:
        - Optimized `.gitignore` to strictly exclude kernel build artifacts (`*.ko`, `*.cmd`, `target/`).
        - Completed a **Force-Push** to the private repository, securing the final verified build-structure for transition to Native Linux. 
    - **Kernel-Space Breakthrough Milestones**
        - Relocation Error Investigation persistent Unknown rela relocation: 9 (R_X86_64_GOTPCREL) error.
        - Root cause: mismatch between modern LLVM-generated code and strict Linux kernel module loader requirements.
    - **The "No-SSE" Paradigm Shift**
        - Successfully bypassed critical SSE/AVX instruction set conflicts.
        - Overrode Rust compiler default behavior with custom Safe Mode (No-SSE) logic.
        - Ensured zero kernel crashes due to floating-point usage.
    - **Symbol Visibility & Linking Mastery**
        - Resolved Unknown symbol deadlock between C and Rust.
        - Pioneered "Ghost-Binding" strategy: utilized `ghost_shell-y` object grouping in Kbuild to unify Rust static library (`.a`) and C shim (`.o`) into a single cohesive kernel entity.
    - **Privilege & Identity Confirmation**
        - Verified module's administrative standing with Taint Bit 4098 (OOT/GPL-compatible).
        - Confirmed status as high-privilege, autonomous kernel actor.
    - **Operational Success (The Milestone)**
        - Successfully loaded GHOST Layer into kernel space via `insmod`
        - Verified flawless execution of `init_hook` and `cleanup_hook`: stable entry/exit cycles without memory leaks or pointer corruption
        - Achieved real-time Kernel-Space Interception: dumped `/etc/passwd` metadata directly via Rust-Kernel Bridge, proving system-call hijacking logic is operational
    - **Docker Environment Decoupling**
        - Conducted deep-dive investigation into environment-specific bugs.
        - Conclusively proved build failures were purely architectural (Symbol/Relocation), not container-induced — exonerating Docker-based toolchain.
    - **Status**
        - Mission Accomplished. **The "Ghost" is inside.** 👻
        - Ready to deploy the `vfs_write` interception engine.
